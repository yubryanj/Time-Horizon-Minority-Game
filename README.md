# Time Horizon Minority Game

This repository reproduces "'Illusion of control' in Time-Horizon Minority and Parrondo Games”[1].  The time horizon minority game is an agent based model of a negative-sum game in which the performance of optimizing(learning) agents < single-strategy agents < random-strategy agents.  Through "simple" dynamics, the Time-horizon minority game is a didactic example on the limitations of learning in the face of complex systems.
